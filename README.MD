# MetaFlip Front-End/style/API 

The aim of MetaFlip is to allow users to make trust-free purchases using Ethereum to sell digital and virtual products. The API is meant to serve as an Ethereum payment method, served to the users in a new <about blank> page, using the MetaMask wallet and confirming that the payment has been completed, or if it's failed. The repository uses semantic HTML, TailwindCSS, Javascript and Solidity.
